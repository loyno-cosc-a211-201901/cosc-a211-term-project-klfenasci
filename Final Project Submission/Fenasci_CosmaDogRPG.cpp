//The program is an RPG game that is going to give the story of the first dog to go into space
//The user will start by picking a character: either the dog, Laika, or a Russian scientist, Vladimir Yazdovsky
//Either way, the user will go through the process of obtaining Laika (she a stray "rescued" from the streets of Moscow), training Laika to go into space,
// and then sending her into space, in which she died in orbit; overall, the story will end by describing that this was the influence behind
//the name of the band I'm in, Cosma Dog
//Some of the calculations the program will have to do will be while training Laika, such as things like decibal noise and g force, etc.
